# Css and Firebase Practice
This is a Friday Epicodus project where we improve the fields we are weak in, and for me it will be making more complex front end and using more CSS styles for our previous project "Animal-Tracker", and implementing firebase.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
